/**
 * ⚠️ DEPRECATED - No longer used
 * 
 * This file was created for local API proxy, but the implementation
 * now uses corsproxy.io for CORS handling, which is simpler and more reliable.
 * 
 * The fetch function now directly calls:
 * https://corsproxy.io/?https://sanskrit.ie/api/geeta.php?q=${chapterNumber}
 * 
 * You can safely delete this file and the src/routes directory.

// This file is not used - see GitaChapters.svelte for the actual implementation
